# Schoology-Go
*Schoology-Go* is a Golang package to interact with the [Schoology REST API](https://developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/rest-api-v1).

# Project Goal
To create a functional Go wrapper for the entire Schoology REST API. See above link for all available endpoints.


# What is here now?
Structs for the various data types the API can return, a couple functions to actually interact with the API and constants for things such as the grade levels and class types, which are returned as ints.

### A quick note
This is the first actual package I've written for Golang, so it might be messy and ugly at times, but as I progress I will hopefully be able to clean it up.
